# PPA-Analysis-of-3D-SOC

•	Simulated and evaluated routing algorithms using Ratatoskr to benchmark latency and throughput.

•	Modelled 3D NoC architectures for comprehensive Power, Performance, Area(PPA) analysis.

•	Focused on addressing traffic congestion and optimizing routing strategies for better performance.

Forked and used ratatoskr simulator and configured the necessary files requireed for our setup, link: https://github.com/MalayRoy153/ratatoskr.git
